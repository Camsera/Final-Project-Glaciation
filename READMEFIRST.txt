Hello Professor Krause,

Thank you again for your help and instruction in this course. 
To run the game, please open the "Glaciation.java" file and run from that point.
All of the java files included are part of this program. I was a little
overconfident with my ability to make this more object oriented, but I hope
you enjoy the game. I really slaved over this one, it was tough but fun!

THANK YOU!!
